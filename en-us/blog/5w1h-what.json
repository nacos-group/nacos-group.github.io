Or, simple and rude,Log in to the machine directly to modify the configuration file,And then restart the app,Let the configuration take effect. Of course, you can also add a timing task to the code,For example, read the content of the configuration file every 10s, so that the latest configuration can take effect in the application in time, so that the &quot;heavier&quot; operation and maintenance operation of restarting the application is eliminated.</p>\n<p>By adding &quot;persistent logic&quot; and &quot;timed tasks&quot;, the form of &quot;configuration files&quot; is a small step forward than &quot;hard-code&quot;.</p>\n<h2>Database configuration table</h2>\n<p>Database can be a relational database such as MySQL or a non-relational database such as Redis. The data table is as follows：</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CREATE</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">TABLE</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">`config`</span> (\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">`id`</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">bigint</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">unsigned</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT</span> <span class=\"hljs-literal\">NULL</span> AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">`key`</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">varchar</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT</span> <span class=\"hljs-literal\">NULL</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">DEFAULT</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">''</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">COMMENT</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'配置项'</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">`value`</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">varchar</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT</span> <span class=\"hljs-literal\">NULL</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">DEFAULT</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">''</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">COMMENT</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'配置内容'</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">`updated_time`</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">timestamp</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT</span> <span class=\"hljs-literal\">NULL</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">DEFAULT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">ON</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">UPDATE</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">`created_time`</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">timestamp</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT</span> <span class=\"hljs-literal\">NULL</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">DEFAULT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</span>,\n  PRIMARY <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">KEY</span> (<span class=\"hljs-string\">`id`</span>),\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">UNIQUE</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">KEY</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">`idx_key`</span> (<span class=\"hljs-string\">`key`</span>)\n) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">ENGINE</span>=<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">InnoDB</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">DEFAULT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CHARSET</span>=utf8 <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">COMMENT</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">'配置信息'</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INSERT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INTO</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">`config`</span> (<span class=\"hljs-string\">`key`</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">`value`</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">`updated_time`</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">`created_time`</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">VALUES</span> (<span class=\"hljs-string\">'connectTimeoutInMills'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'5000'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</span>);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Compared with the first two, it takes the configuration a step further, separates the configuration from the application, and centrally manages it, which can greatly reduce the operation and maintenance cost.</p>\n<p>So, how can it solve the problem of dynamically updating the configuration? As far as I know, there are two ways。</p>\n<p>One,Same as before,Solve by exposing management interface,Of course,Also need to increase the logic of persistence,But before it was to write files, now it is to write the latest configuration to the database. However, the program also needs to periodically read the latest configuration task from the database, so that only by calling the management configuration interface of one of the machines, the latest configuration can be distributed to all the machines in the entire application cluster. Really achieve the purpose of reducing operation and maintenance costs.</p>\n<p>Second,Modify the database directly, and read the latest configuration content from the database through timed tasks in the program.</p>\n<p>The form of &quot;Database configuration table&quot; solves the main problem, but it is not elegant enough and brings some &quot;cumbersome&quot;.</p>\n<h2>Nacos configuration management</h2>\n<p>Nacos truly separates the configuration from the application, manages it in a unified way, and elegantly solves the problems of dynamic changes, persistence, operation and maintenance costs of the configuration.</p>\n<p>The application itself does not need to add a management configuration interface, nor does it need to implement configuration persistence by itself, and it does not need to introduce &quot;timed tasks&quot; in order to reduce operation and maintenance costs. Nacos The provided configuration management function gathers all the logic related to the configuration, and provides a simple and easy-to-use SDK, so that the configuration of the application can be easily managed by Nacos.</p>\n<p>If you are using Nacos in Spring, you only need three steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add dependency</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plain\">&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.alibaba.nacos&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;nacos-spring-context&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;${latest.version}&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Add <code>@EnableNacosConfig</code> annotation,Enable Nacos Spring's configuration management service。In the following example, we use <code>@NacosPropertySource</code> to load the configuration source with <code>dataId</code> as <code>example</code> and enable automatic update:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plain\">@Configuration\n@EnableNacosConfig(globalProperties = @NacosProperties(serverAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1:8848&quot;))\n@NacosPropertySource(dataId = &quot;example&quot;, autoRefreshed = true)\npublic class NacosConfiguration {\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Set the attribute value through Spring's <code>@Value</code> annotation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: You need to have the <code>Setter</code> method at the same time to automatically update when the configuration changes.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plain\">public class AppConfig {\n\n    @Value(&quot;${connectTimeoutInMills:5000}&quot;)\n    private int connectTimeoutInMills;\n\n    public int getConnectTimeoutInMills() {\n        return connectTimeoutInMills;\n    }\n\n    public void setConnectTimeoutInMills(int connectTimeoutInMills) {\n        this.connectTimeoutInMills = connectTimeoutInMills;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above three steps have almost no code intrusion to the application itself,1 dependency 2 annotations,With just a few lines, the configuration is managed through Nacos.</p>\n<p>About the dynamic update of the configuration,For users of Nacos Spring, it is just a boolean value of &quot;autoRefreshed&quot; that is set in their own application。Then when you need to modify the configuration, call Nacos to modify the configuration interface, or use the Nacos console to modify. After the configuration is changed, Nacos will push the latest configuration to all the machines of the application, which is simple and efficient.</p>\n<p>Think about it before, in order to realize this function, how much wrong code was written, and how much tedious operation and maintenance work was done. It would be great if you had met Nacos earlier!</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This article serves as the beginning of the Nacos 5W1H series,&quot;What&quot; tells the problem that Nacos configuration management can help us solve: manage configuration in a simple, elegant, and efficient way, realize dynamic configuration changes, greatly reduce operation and maintenance costs, and let developers leave work earlier.</p>\n<p>Of course, Nacos configuration management is not only the above-mentioned functions, but also such as &quot;gray release&quot;, &quot;version management&quot;, &quot;fast rollback&quot;, &quot;monitor query&quot;, &quot;push trajectory&quot;, &quot;authority control&quot;, &quot;Encrypted storage of sensitive configuration (eg, database connection configuration)&quot; etc.. Some of these have been implemented in open source in Nacos, and some are provided in the free product of Alibaba Cloud <a href=\"https://cn.aliyun.com/product/acm\">ACM</a> of Nacos configuration management. Of course, the follow-up will be slow Slowly open source to Nacos, so stay tuned.</p>\n<p>This series of articles,Will continue to tell everyone about Nacos bit by bit,It's not just about &quot;What problem can Nacos help us solve?&quot;,There will also be an in-depth source code analysis &quot;How is Nacos simple and powerful?&quot;。At the same time, if the guys are interested, we will also give you gossip about Nacos' history of barnyard officials, about the history of Nacos in Ali, about the meaning of the Nacos service port, etc.. In short, one sentence: I have a story, and I also have a good wine, what else can you ask for?</p>\n",
