If you want to contribute even something trivial, please do not hesitate, but follow the guidelines below.</p>\n<p>We are always very happy to have contributions, whether for trivial cleanups or big new features.\nWe want to have high quality, well documented codes for each programming language.</p>\n<p>Nor is code the only way to contribute to the project. We strongly value documentation, integration with other project, and gladly accept improvements for these aspects.</p>\n<h2>Contact us</h2>\n<h5>Nacos Gitter- <a href=\"https://gitter.im/alibaba/nacos\">https://gitter.im/alibaba/nacos</a></h5>\n<h5>Nacos weibo- <a href=\"https://weibo.com/u/6574374908\">https://weibo.com/u/6574374908</a></h5>\n<h5>Nacos segmentfault- <a href=\"https://segmentfault.com/t/nacos\">https://segmentfault.com/t/nacos</a></h5>\n<h4>Mailing list</h4>\n<p>Mailing list is recommended for discussing almost anything related to Nacos.

This is usually the master branch.</li>\n<li>Make commits of logical units.</li>\n<li>Make sure commit messages are in the proper format (see below).</li>\n<li>Push changes in a topic branch to your forked repository.</li>\n<li>Follow the checklist in the <a href=\"https://nacos.io/en-us/docs/pull-request.html\">pull request template</a>.</li>\n<li>Before you send the pull request, please sync your forked repository with remote repository. This will make your pull request simple and clear. See guide below:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>git remote add upstream git@github.com:alibaba/nacos.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master\ngit checkout -b your_awesome_patch\n... add some work\ngit push origin your_awesome_patch\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Submit a pull request to alibaba/nacos and wait for reply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Detail contribution flow see <a href=\"contributing-flow.html\">Contribution Flow</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for contributing!</p>\n<h2>Contributing Document</h2>\n<h3>Notice</h3>\n<p>When contributing documents, please confirm and check the following:</p>\n<h4>Has been confirmed that the document is indeed wrong or missing.</h4>\n<h4>Familiar with <a href=\"https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started\">Markdown</a></h4>\n<h4>Familiar with <a href=\"https://github.com/txd-team/docsite\">docsite</a>, at least be able to complete local debugging according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/nacos-group/nacos-group.github.io\">document README.md</a>.</h4>\n<h2>Becoming a Committer</h2>\n<p>We are always interested in adding new contributors.
