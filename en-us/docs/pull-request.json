Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.</li>\n<li>[ ] Format the pull request title like <code>[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist</code>. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.</li>\n<li>[ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.</li>\n<li>[ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test\">test module</a>.</li>\n<li>[ ] Run <code>mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs</code> to make sure basic checks pass. Run <code>mvn clean install -DskipITs</code> to make sure unit-test pass. Run <code>mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test</code>  to make sure integration-test pass.</li>\n<li>[ ] If this contribution is large, please file an <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas\">Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n",
