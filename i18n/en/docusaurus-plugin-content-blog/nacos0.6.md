# Nacos Released version 0.6, supports Dubbo and Docker

> Authors: 马昕曦、张龙、邢学超

 Alibaba Microservices Open Source Project[Dubbo Nacos](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos)released this week __v0.6__ version, which mainly supports Dubbo's service registration and discovery and configuration management, supports docker deployment, provides an official docker image, optimizes the international framework of Nacos console, and optimizes Nacos's integration testing efficiency.

## Thousands of calls come out, Dubbo's registration center and configuration center

__Nacos__ Starting with the __v0.6__ version, the __Dubbo__ registration center and configuration center are supported. Also, as Alibaba's open source weight-level product, the two products are inextricably linked within the internal Alibaba Group.

### Dubbo Service Framework

As the rpc service framework, on the one hand, it pays attention to the extremely short delay rt, which ensures that the overall call is efficient, and on the other hand, guarantees a good user experience, ensuring user comfort and good scalability. Dubbo is very good in both aspects, and is widely used in the industry because of its good expansion. The popularity and popularity of Dubbo is evident through the 2w+ github warehouse star attention.

### Nacos and Dubbo are the same genes

But there is such an efficient rpc service framework under Alibaba's technology system, but what is supporting Alibaba's huge service cluster? It is well known that Alibaba Group has a terrible cluster size. Every year, Alibaba Group's Tmall Double 11 Global Shopping Carnival will have a rid of the chin trading scale. In 2018, the Double 11 will carry 213.5 billion in sales. But as a technician, the biggest concern is the peak. If careful practitioners should see an indicator, in 2018 Tmall carried a peak of transaction creation of 491,000 pens per second. For example, Beijing Bird's Nest Stadium has a maximum carrying capacity of 91,000 people, and 49.1w transactions per second, which means that the full audience of the five Bird's Nest stadiums pushes the shopping cart and simultaneously clears the settlement of Tmall Taobao in one second. Taiwan, this pressure can be imagined. But behind the hosting of such a large-scale service cluster, and Alibaba Dubbo's internal use framework HSF, corresponding to ConfigServer, and this is one of Nacos' predecessors. The 0.6 version released by Nacos is the perfect integration with Dubbo. It also announces that Alibaba's experience in large-scale clusters will be shared with Nacos, Dubbo, Sentinel and other contributions to the open source community.

### Dubbo Fusion Nacos

Nacos is an important registry infrastructure in the Dubbo ecosystem, with [dubbo-registry-nacos](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-registry-nacos) being the bridge for Dubbo's Fusion Nacos registry, based on Dubbo Powerful [Registry SPI](http://dubbo.apache.org/en-us/docs/dev/impls/registry.html) and Nacos Naming services provide real-time service registration and discovery. Currently [dubbo-registry-nacos](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-registry-nacos) is in the preview stage, the latest release is `0.0.2`, the latest Dubbo and Dubbo OPS have been tested, recommended Developers use the latest Dubbo `2.6.5` and Nacos `0.6.1` to ensure the best experience. If you are currently using ZooKeeper or Redis as your registry, the migration to Nacos is also very simple, with Zookeeper as an example:

* Scene 1: Externalization configuration

Pre-adjustment configuration:

```properties
## Zookeeper registry address
Dubbo.registry.address = zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181
```

Adjusted configuration:

```properties
## Nacos registry address
Dubbo.registry.address = nacos://127.0.0.1:8848
```

* Scenario 2: XML configuration driver

Pre-adjustment configuration:

```xml
<!-- Use Zookeeper Registration Center -->
<dubbo:registry address="zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181" />
```

Adjusted configuration:

```xml
<!-- Use Nacos Registration Center -->
<dubbo:registry address="nacos://127.0.0.1:8848" />
```

Once the adjustment is complete, make sure the Nacos Server is up and restart your Dubbo app, then you will see the registration information in the Nacos console Service List:

## Containers are popular, Nacos supports Docker containerization

Today, when containers are popular, support for containerization has become a necessity, and Docker has chosen as the container for most people. Nacos announced in v0.6.
Support for Docker deployments, and provide an official image, and will support k8s deployment in the next few releases.

### How to deploy via Docker

Local needs to make sure that Docker has been followed. If it is not installed, please refer to [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/). After installation, you can quickly pull the image from the remote and pick up a stand-alone version of Nacos to experience it.
Simple and rude, run the following command:

```plain
Docker run --name nacos-standalone -e MODE=standalone -p 8848:8848 nacos/nacos-server:latest
```

The operation test is as follows:


![Peek 2018-12-13 11-43.gif | left | 747x407](https://cdn.nlark.com/lark/0/2018/gif/11189/1544701054438-de9785c4-b9ab-46dc-a162-d22e1419a172.gif "")


Another application, [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) orchestration, you can refer to the following command:

1. git clone the project and go to the project root directory

```powershell
Git clone https://github.com/nacos-group/nacos-docker.git
Cd nacos-docker
```

2. Start

* Stand-alone start

```powershell
Docker-compose -f example/standalone.yaml up
```

* Cluster boot

```powershell
Docker-compose -f example/cluster-hostname.yaml up
```

At this point your Nacos is up and you can experience the Nacos feature by visiting [http://localhost:8848/nacos/index.html](http://localhost:8848/nacos/index.html).
