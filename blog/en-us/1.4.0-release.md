## Nacos 1.4.0

Main upgrade in 1.4.0:

1. Refactors the distro protocol of the naming module and sinks to the nacos-core module.
1. Used jraft to replace the old self-implemented raft protocol to improve the performance and accuracy of raft semantics.
1. Unifies the http clients completely used by nacos, optimizes the usage of some http clients, and reduces connection cost, especially the number of CLOSE_WAIT connections.
1. Add a BETA interface to modify service metadata separately.
1. Fix some old version bugs and optimized console usage.
